# Welcome to the xLAM-2 Model Family!

[Large Action Models (LAMs)](https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/large-action-models/) are advanced language models designed to enhance decision-making by translating user intentions into executable actions. As the **brains of AI agents**, LAMs autonomously plan and execute tasks to achieve specific goals, making them invaluable for automating workflows across diverse domains.  
**This model release is for research purposes only.**  

The new **xLAM-2** series, built on our most advanced data synthesis, processing, and training pipelines, marks a significant leap in **multi-turn conversation** and **tool usage**. Trained using our novel APIGen-MT framework, which generates high-quality training data through simulated agent-human interactions. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on **BFCL** and **Ï„-bench** benchmarks, outperforming frontier models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5. Notably, even our smaller models demonstrate superior capabilities in multi-turn scenarios while maintaining exceptional consistency across trials.

We've also refined the **chat template** and **vLLM integration**, making it easier to build advanced AI agents. Compared to previous xLAM models, xLAM-2 offers superior performance and seamless deployment across applications.

***Note:** The default context length for Qwen-2.5-based models is 32k, but you can use techniques like YaRN (Yet Another Recursive Network) to achieve maximum 128k context length. Please refer to [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct#processing-long-texts) for more details.

## Usage

### Framework versions

- Transformers 4.46.1 (or later)
- PyTorch 2.5.1+cu124 (or later)
- Datasets 3.1.0 (or later)
- Tokenizers 0.20.3 (or later)

### Basic Usage with Huggingface Chat Template

The new xLAM models are designed to work seamlessly with the Hugging Face Transformers library and utilize natural chat templates for an easy and intuitive conversational experience. Below are examples of how to use these models.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Salesforce/Llama-xLAM-2-3b-fc-r")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Salesforce/Llama-xLAM-2-3b-fc-r", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")

# Example conversation with a tool call
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, how are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks. I am doing well. How can I help you?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in London?"},
]

tools = [
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather for a location",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"},
                "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"], "description": "The unit of temperature to return"}
            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    }
]

print("====== prompt after applying chat template ======")
print(tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tools=tools, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False))

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tools=tools, add_generation_prompt=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors="pt")
input_ids_len = inputs["input_ids"].shape[-1] # Get the length of the input tokens
inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}
print("====== model response ======")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=256)
generated_tokens = outputs[:, input_ids_len:] # Slice the output to get only the newly generated tokens
print(tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

<!-- ### Using vLLM for Inference

The xLAM models can also be efficiently served using vLLM for high-throughput inference. Please refer to the vLLM documentation for detailed instructions on how to deploy and use these models. You can typically start the vLLM service with the model name:

```bash
vllm serve Salesforce/xLAM-2-3b-fc-r
```

And then interact with the model using your preferred method for querying a vLLM endpoint. -->
